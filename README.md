# FORWARD STOCK PLAN AUTOMATION

Forward Stock Plan Automation is a Python terminal program, which is designed to aid to logistic and supply function of distribution and wholesaling companies in order to manage their stock levels and place timely orders. This business process is an everyday job if a distributor strives to avoid out-of-stock situations. An automation of the process becomes a must-have tool for importers, distributors and wholesalers

## Business Context
Once there is always a non-zero time between placing an order and a delivery of an item the inbound logistics of any business will face a problem of proper stocks control. Such time when the goods are actually in transit is usually called by distributors "__a lead time__". The problem becomes an essential challenge for a business when marketing cycle of that business is comparable to lead times and sometimes may take more then one week, or several weeks or even more than a month (for example, as regards the imports from China)

I developed this application aiming at automation of this process for mid-size and smaller businesses that cannot afford the expensive software and try to cope with the task by means of Excel or other spreadsheet applications.

A Python-based system can offer significant advantages over a purely Excel-based system in terms of data handling, integration with other systems, customization, scalability and data protection. Python can automate mundane tasks, making them much more efficient. This is particularly useful for tasks such as updating sales forecasts, calculating order recommendations, and controlling stock levels. Automation can reduce the risk of human error, increase efficiency, and free up time for more strategic tasks.

Basically, what the application does can be briefly described as follows:

- updates weekly sales forecasts based on actual sales input and retrospective sales
- calculates forward stock plan (future stocks) at the beginning of every coming week to the end of a year and based on weekly  delivery plan
- calculates orders recommendations: quantities per item and time for placement
- updates delivery plan after any change in orders 
- updates forward stock plan based on new order plan and/or sales forecast

At the current version of the application there are 2 product ranges used as templates: 
- Planters nuts with 6 product items
- Ritter Sport chocolate bars with 4 product items

The application assumes easy settings for adding both new product ranges and new product items within a range.

## Glossary Of Terms
    
    "Product Ranges" - product items under one umbrella brand.
    Currently there are two product ranges: Planters and
    Ritter Sport

    "Week Number" - the number of the week in the year
    
    "Weekly Sales" - the number of units sold in the chosen week
    or with regards to future weeks - sales forecast

    "Weekly Stocks" - the number of units in stock at 
    (important!) the beginning of the week

    "Orders" - the number of units to be ordered in 
    a particular week (recommendation) taking into
    consideration the lead time of particular Product Range

    "Deliveries" - the number of units delivered in 
    the past week or with regards to future weeks - 
    to be delivered at the estimated week of delivery

    "Lead Time" - the number of weeks between placing 
    the order and receiving the delivery. The delivered
    goods become available for sale only from the next week
    after estimated arrival (Lead Time + 1)

    "Forward Stock Plan" - the number of units in stock 
    estimated for all future weeks at the current rate of 
    sales and expected deliveries

    "Safety Margin" - the percentage of additional units to 
    order on top of the average sales to avoid stockouts
